# Animal Trading Card Project

## Instructions

This project involved separating all of the style information from the HTML and putting it in styles.css. Udacity required us to imitate the styling of an animal trading card prototype. I customized the card with my own animal image and text, linked the style sheet, and included class attributes.

## Monarch Butterflies

The reason I went with the monarch butterfly is that it has four stages in its life cycle: the egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and mature butterfly. In a similar vein, humans go through many phases of life, such as childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. The incredible journey that is life can and almost certainly will lead to personal development and/or adjustments that have an impact on our identity and way of life. Lastly, as pollinators, monarch butterflies are essential to ecosystems. Similarly, regardless of our intentions, all humans leave their mark on Earth. Future generations rely on humanity to make wise decisions to protect and maintain the environment and its natural resources.
